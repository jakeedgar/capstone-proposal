### Name of Student: Jake Edgar
### Name of Project: BLOOM.AI
##### Project's Purpose or Goal: 
  * Bloom is a web application that allows a user to input a paragraph of text (minimum 200 words at this time) and then return the same text, transformed into erasure poetry. 
### List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
  * Basic algorithm to convert a users input into a styled poem. 
  * Custom UI with decent palette and basic animation / interactivity. 
    * such as: animated buttons, a clean navbar etc. 
  * User Login for Admin. 
### What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
  * React
  * TypeScript
  * CSS in JS (Custom)
  * Firebase / MongoDB / Prisma for DB 
  * Redux / THUNK
  * HTML
  * Express / node 
  * Python (For the algorithm)
### If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific. 
  * A more complex Algorithm
  * The ability to download / save poems to an individual user account. 
  * A full fleshed out JSS component library hosted by NPM. 
### What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
  * A custom api / algorithm that sorts the words will likely have to be implemented. That or an SDK that utilizes the WORDS API that is already out there. 
### Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know? 
  * Not at this time.
